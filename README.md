# Time-ToDo
### By Daniel Michelin

## Introduction
This is a pet project entirely designed by myself to get familiar with developing for the android operating system. The idea of the application is to provide users with a todo list that can have a timer built in to the items. This is much like a calendar, but is slightly more flexible and less cumbersome for spontanious activities.
## What Works, What Doesn't, What Needs Work
### Works
The basic functionality of the app currently works. It goes through a list of items and starts a timer for each one of them, recursively. Creating and storing items is persistent
### Doesn't Work
The app does not work in the background and does not produce notifications. Also it does not have a help screen
### Needs Work
The app could definitely use a bit more UI polish
